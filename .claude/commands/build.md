# Build and Fix

Run the build process and fix any issues that arise:

1. First, run `npm run build` to identify any build errors
2. Analyze the output for TypeScript errors, ESLint issues, or other problems
3. Systematically fix each issue found
4. Re-run the build to verify all issues are resolved
5. If build succeeds, run `npm run lint` to check for any additional linting issues
6. Fix any linting problems found

Please report back with a summary of what was fixed and confirm the build is now successful.
